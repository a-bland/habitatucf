          A Build allows you to immerse yourself in the process of becoming a homeowner through Habitat. We join homeowners in any part of the construction or renovation process during Builds.</p>
        <p>
          Builds open many people’s eyes as to what it takes to provide shelter for someone. Don’t worry if you have zero construction experience; everyone is welcome. Habitat for Humanity is a place where you can learn new skills while helping the community.</p>
         <p>
          Join us every other Saturday of each month; we carpool from the University of Central Florida campus. In order to attend Builds, you’ll need to become a member of Habitat at UCF.</p>
