          We volunteer occasionally with the ReStore program of Habitat for Humanity. These stores sell used furniture, appliances, home accessories, building materials, and other home goods at discounted prices. Anyone is welcome to use them. The proceeds are used to help build strength, stability, self-reliance, and shelter in communities around us.</p>
        <p>
         Tasks we are involved with usually include moving items in the store, organizing various materials and goods into their proper places within the store, and anything else that helps the store operate more efficiently. Sometimes we help build things like a shelf to improve organization in the store or we get to do some demolition to get rid of materials that are too damaged to sell.</p>
         <p>
          Carpools are provided whenever we have a volunteer event. If you’d like to participate in our restores, you’re always welcome! The only requirement is becoming a member.</p>
