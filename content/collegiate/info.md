          Collegiate Challenge is our Alternative Break Program. Spend your break helping others with these awesome opportunities. We’ve been to places such as the West Virginia, Louisiana, and the Carolinas.</p>
        <p>
          These trips are both a life-changing experience for you and those you will be helping. Spend four days building a house, meeting new friends, and the fifth exploring the area. This experience will be one you’ll never forget!</p>
         <p>
          Our last Collegiate was the first week of winter break, and we went to Mandeville Louisiana, which is less than an hour from New Orleans. Unfortunately, Collegiates are cancelled until further notice due to the coronavirus.</p>
